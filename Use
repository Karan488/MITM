A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. 
MiTM cyber attacks pose a serious threat to online security because they give the attacker the ability to capture and manipulate sensitive personal information -- such as login credentials, account details or credit card numbers -- in real time.
